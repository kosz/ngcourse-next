# Angular Course from rangle.io

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.

This repository contains handout materials and code for rangle.io's AngularJS
training course, focusing on building Angular 1.x applications the Angular 2 way.

This is meant to be used as a part of the course, which is
normally offered as a 2-3 day event. See [http://rangle.io/javascript-training.html](http://rangle.io/javascript-training.html) for more
information.

## The Handouts

THE HANDOUTS ARE YET TO BE UPDATED TO MATCH THE CHANGES TO THE CODE.

See the [handout](https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse/tree/master/handout) for
the handout. You can either view it in your browser or build it into a PDF
using the instructions in the README file in the handout directory.

## The Code

The repository also contains the codebase that we'll work on in throughout the
course. The project has a server and the client component. This repository
contains only the *client* code. The server code is available at
https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse-api/. You do **not** need the server code to
run the front end, however. Instead, you can access the API server deployed to
http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/ and will develop the client-side code on your
own machine.

The students should start by checking out the "base" branch for their session, which has all the necessary configurations but no actual client side code. The "master" branch contains the final state of the project.

You will then need to use `bower` to install the dependencies:

```bash
  sudo npm install -g bower # skip "sudo" on windows
  bower install
```

You will then need to build the front end using:

```bash
  npm install
  gulp build
```

You will also need to install TypeScript definition files specified in tsd.json at the root of the project

```
tsd reinstall -s
```

Once you've done that, you can access the front-end of the project, by running a simple server such as `http-server` with client as the root directory. You will need to install bower and run

```bash
  sudo npm install -g http-server # skip "sudo" on windows
  http-server client -p 3000
```

(Any other static web server should do, though.)

Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

If you see a login screen, you are all set. You can login as "alice" with
password "x", at which point you should see a list of tasks.
